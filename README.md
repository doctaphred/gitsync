## Reflections Upon First Use

This is *definitely* a terrible idea

I am scared to death of making typos

omg why would ANYBODY ever actually use this

If nothing else, at least it led me to discover [this gem of the
'90s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byuPyhx5Ytg)

Is it cheating to reorder my thoughts, or post them out of order?

Welp, now I understand firsthand why Google Wave totally tanked.

I wonder how long until I get rate limited...

It's interesting to finally have exposed to me how nonlinear my edits tend to
be: I've had a half-finished sub-thought for a previous point in my clipboard
for a few commits now, because I have this instinct to keep my commits atomic.
Pretty sure that's not really relevant here, but the thought persists.

Gives a new perspective for that whole "nightly build" thing...

So the original idea behind this project was to reduce the friction between me
and my git remotes, in order to avoid the problems that come up when I let my
home directory configs get out of sync between machines.
